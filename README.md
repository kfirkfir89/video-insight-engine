# 🎬 VIE — Video Insight Engine

> **Stop losing knowledge from videos you watch.**

You watch a 2-hour tutorial, learn amazing things, and a week later... it's gone. You can't remember the exact steps, you can't find that one explanation that clicked, and you definitely can't explain it to someone else.
**Video Insight Engine fixes this.**

---

## The Problem

📺 You watch educational YouTube videos all the time.

😤 But videos are **terrible for knowledge retention**:

- Can't search inside them
- Can't highlight or save key parts
- Can't quickly review what you learned
- Rewatching wastes hours

**Result:** 90% of video knowledge evaporates within a week.

## The Solution

> **Turn any YouTube video into an interactive app.**

You paste a URL. VIE analyzes the video — transcript, frames, structure — and generates a custom interactive experience with the right components for that content. A cooking video becomes a recipe with timed steps and ingredient checklist. A tech tutorial becomes a code explorer with runnable snippets. A travel vlog becomes a spot explorer with a visual timeline.

Not a summary. Not a transcript. An **app built from the video's content.**

---

## What VIE Produces

Every video gets a unique set of **interactive tabs** — chosen automatically based on what the video is about.

```

🤖 AI Pipeline (classify + plan → extract → assemble)
      ↓
🎯 Knowledge Base Interactive Tabs (tailored to content type)
```

### A cooking video might get:

| Tab               | Component  | What it does                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛒 Ingredients    | checklist   | Checkable shopping list with quantities               |
| 👨‍🍳 Steps          | step_player | Timed cooking steps with "Watch this step" video seek |
| 🔪 Tips           | flash_deck  | Swipeable chef tips and storage advice                |
| ⏰ Moments        | moment_track | Value gallery of key moments — click opens a frame lightbox, an explicit Jump button seeks the video |
| 🎞️ Filmstrip      | video_filmstrip | Enriched frame scrubber with captions (suppressed when Moments already covers the frames) |

### A tech tutorial might get:

| Tab         | Component    | What it does                             |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 💻 Code     | code_playground | Syntax-highlighted code blocks with copy |
| 📋 Steps    | step_player  | Setup instructions with timestamps       |
| 🔧 Tools    | checklist    | Required tools and dependencies          |
| 📚 Concepts | flash_deck   | Key concept flashcards                   |
| 🧠 Quiz     | quiz_arena   | Knowledge check (educational domains only) |

### 29 registered components available:

moment_track, step_player, spot_explorer, flash_deck, checklist, info_grid, overview, comparison, comparison_radar, budget, code_playground, quiz_arena, packing_mission, workout_room, lyrics_karaoke, video_filmstrip, claims_tracker, tier_list, formation_diagram, concept_canvas, step_flow_canvas, connect_canvas, display_section + secondary attachments (stat_banner, tip_callout, summary_header, diagram_card, frame_strip, quick_quiz)

The AI picks which components to use based on the video's content — not a template.

## How It Works

### The Pipeline

```
URL → Metadata → [Transcript ∥ Frames] → Classify + Plan → Extraction → Synthesis → Enrichment → Assembly → SSE Stream → React UI
```

Each stage is a separate async phase. The pipeline streams results to the frontend via Server-Sent Events — the user sees tabs appearing progressively as they're assembled.

### Key Architecture Decisions

**Plan-driven:** A fast classifier plus a single Sonnet plan call classify the video (content tags like "food", "tech", "travel") and design the tab layout. This means a 10-min recipe and a 10-min code tutorial produce completely different output — same pipeline, different components.

**Domain-specific extraction:** 14 domain schemas (learning, tech, fitness, food, music, travel, review, project, language, science, gaming, news, podcast, sport + narrative, finance modifiers) define exactly what data to extract per content type. A food video extracts ingredients, steps, tips. A tech video extracts code snippets, tools, concepts.

**Component-addressed assembly:** Extraction output is transformed into props for specific React components. The frontend just does `INTERACTIVE_REGISTRY[tab.component]` — one lookup, one render.

**Frame extraction with smart scoring:** Two-pass. Pass 1: FFmpeg scene detection on a fast worst-quality download produces ~200 candidates, scored locally on six signals (color saturation, face, skin fraction, center detail, text density, uniqueness); ~25 winners are selected. Pass 2: only the winners are re-extracted at 720p (stream-URL seek, with a local-download fallback for CDN-403 environments) before S3 upload, so vision, OCR, and the UI all get hi-res frames. A versioned S3 manifest (`scenes-v3`) caches the result — including the vision descriptions — for instant re-serves.

**Chunked extraction for long videos:** Videos over 30 minutes are split by YouTube chapters (or AI-detected chapters, or 5-minute time splits). Chapters are batched into LLM calls up to the context window limit. A 9-hour video needs ~10 LLM calls total, not 100+.

**Inline video player with seekTo:** Click any timestamp in any tab → the inline YouTube player (hosted in the video hero) opens, scrolls into view, and seeks to that moment. Step instructions, filmstrip frames, moment Jump buttons — everything is clickable and connected to the video. Moment cards themselves open a frame lightbox instead of seeking; jumping is always an explicit action.

### Response Shape

### SSE Event Flow

```
metadata → triage_complete → frames → meta → tab_ready × N → synthesis_complete → complete → done
```

Each `tab_ready` event carries one assembled tab plus its `position` in the final tab order. The frontend slots tabs by position as they arrive — moment tabs are held back while exact-timestamp frames are extracted and stream last, so the user sees results appearing in real-time without reordering jumps.

---

## Pipeline Phases (Detail)

### 1. Metadata

Fetch video info via yt-dlp: title, duration, creator, chapters, description, thumbnails, category.

### 2. Transcript (parallel with frames)

Fetch YouTube captions (yt-dlp subtitles → S3 cache → youtube-transcript-api fallback). Clean with spaCy (filler removal, TF-IDF repetition collapse). Filter sponsor segments via SponsorBlock API.

### 3. Frame Extraction (parallel with transcript)

Two-pass. Pass 1: download worst-quality video via yt-dlp (~15-20s; player client set by `YTDLP_PLAYER_CLIENTS`, default `android`). FFmpeg scene detection at threshold 0.3 (~200 candidates). Score each frame locally with OpenCV on six signals: color saturation, face detection (Haar cascades), skin fraction, center detail, text density (Canny edges), visual uniqueness (perceptual hashing). Select ~25 evenly distributed across video duration. Pass 2: re-extract only the winners at 720p (stream-URL seek; local-download fallback when the CDN 403s seeks), then upload to S3 under a versioned prefix with a manifest that also persists the vision descriptions. OCR on text-heavy frames (Tesseract).

### 4. Classify + Plan

A fast classifier (domain + format + traits) runs concurrently with a single Sonnet plan call. Input: video metadata + chapter titles + transcript sample (+ domain playbook if one matches, e.g. unboxing). Output: contentTags, primaryTag, userGoal, tab definitions with component names and goals — with forbidden components stripped before extraction. This decides what the entire extraction phase will look for.

### 5. Extraction

Domain-specific LLM call using schemas from `domains.json`. For short videos: single call with full transcript. For long videos: split by chapters, batch into calls, merge results. Output: structured data per domain (ingredients, steps, code snippets, locations, etc.).

### 6. Synthesis (parallel with assembly)

Fast LLM call. Produces: TLDR, masterSummary, keyTakeaways, seoDescription. For long videos: uses chapter summaries instead of full transcript (hierarchical).

### 7. Enrichment

LLM call for domains with an enrichment mapping. Produces: quiz questions, flashcards, scenario explorations (recall-only domains like podcast/gaming get flashcards only).

### 8. Assembly

No LLM calls. Transforms extraction output into component props for each tab via 29 assemblers, enforcing domain forbidden/max policy and a degrade-never-drop demote ladder. Injects frame thumbnails (nearest-timestamp matching, ±15s backfill), and extracts exact-timestamp frames for still-frameless moments (with SSE heartbeats). Validates all props against component schemas.

---

## Domain Configuration

Single source of truth: `packages/shared/src/config/domains.json`

```json
{
  "food": {
    "label": "Food & Cooking",
    "schemas": ["food"],
    "components": ["checklist", "step_player", "flash_deck", "moment_track"],
    "enrichment": true
  },
  "tech": {
    "label": "Tech & Coding",
    "schemas": ["tech"],
    "components": ["code_playground", "step_player", "checklist", "flash_deck"],
    "enrichment": true
  }
}
```

14 domains: learning, tech, fitness, food, music, travel, review, project, language, science, gaming, news, podcast, sport (+ narrative, finance modifiers). Each domain defines which extraction schemas to use, which components the planner may pick, per-domain required/max/**forbidden** component policy, format-specific playbooks (e.g. `gaming:unboxing`), and visual-criticality tiers for the frame pipeline.

Python reads this via `domain_config.py`. TypeScript reads via `@vie/shared/config`. One config, two runtimes.

---

## Long Video Support

Videos over ~15 minutes (`CHUNKED_EXTRACTION_THRESHOLD` = 900s) use chunked extraction:

```
SHORT (<15 min):   Full transcript → single extraction call
MEDIUM (15-120 min): Chapters → 1-2 batch extraction calls → merge
LONG (2+ hours):   Chapters → 3-5 batch calls → hierarchical synthesis → merge
```

Chapter detection fallback chain: YouTube creator chapters → AI-detected chapters (fast model) → time-based splits (~5 min each) → single chunk.

Multiple chapters are batched into a single LLM call up to the context limit (~50K tokens per batch). A 9-hour video needs ~10 LLM calls total, processing in ~8 minutes.

---

## Frame Pipeline

```
Pass 1 — detect + score (worst-quality download, YTDLP_PLAYER_CLIENTS=android):
  yt-dlp → FFmpeg scene detect (0.3) → ~200 candidates on disk
    ↓
  Score locally (OpenCV, no network, 6 signals):
    - Color saturation (HSV) → catches final dishes, landscapes
    - Face detection (Haar cascade) + skin fraction → penalizes presenter shots
    - Center detail (Laplacian) → catches the subject in frame
    - Text density (Canny edges) → catches slides, code
    - Visual uniqueness (perceptual hash) → catches real scene changes
    ↓
  Adaptive visual tier (domains.json visualCriticality):
    HIGH domains over-select 40 + vision reselect · LOW skips vision · else top-8
    ↓
  Select ~25 evenly distributed across video duration
    ↓
Pass 2 — hi-res refine (SCENE_HIRES_ENABLED):
  re-extract only the winners at 720p via stream-URL seek
  (local ≤720p download fallback when the CDN 403s seeks)
    ↓
Upload winners to S3 under scenes-v3/ + manifest.json (v2 — timestamps,
hiresCount, persisted vision descriptions; hiresCount == 0 counts as a
cache miss so low-res runs self-heal)
    ↓
Thumbnail injection: nearest-timestamp matching (+ ±15s backfill,
exact-timestamp moment frame fill as last resort)
```

---

## Smart Caching

Redis caches the full VIEResponse keyed by `youtube_id` + `PIPELINE_VERSION`. Same video = instant serve from cache ($0.00). No re-processing, no LLM calls. `?bypassCache=true` forces a fresh run.

S3 stores frames and transcripts per video. Frame reuse is manifest-gated: if a valid `scenes-v3/manifest.json` exists (with hi-res frames), frame extraction is skipped entirely — including the vision descriptions, which are restored from the manifest.

| Scenario                    | LLM Calls            | Cost       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| First processing of a video | 5-10                 | $0.02-0.12 |
| Same video, any user        | 0 (cache hit)        | $0.00      |
| Same video, cache expired   | 0 (S3 frames reused) | $0.01      |

---

## Cost Per Video

| Component                                                | Cost           |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Transcript (YouTube captions)                            | $0.00 (free)   |
| Frame extraction (FFmpeg + OpenCV)                       | ~$0.001        |
| OCR on ~22% of frames (Tesseract)                        | ~$0.001        |
| S3 storage (~25 frames × 28KB)                           | ~$0.002        |
| LLM calls (classify + plan + extraction + synthesis + enrichment) | $0.02-0.10 |
| **Total**                                                | **$0.02-0.10** |

Scales with video length: 15 min = ~$0.02, 2 hours = ~$0.05, 9 hours = ~$0.12.

## LLM Provider Support

VIE uses LiteLLM for multi-provider support with automatic fallback:

```
Primary: configurable (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google)
Fast model: configurable (used for classifier, synthesis, enrichment, vision)
Fallback: automatic on rate limit or error
```

| Provider  | Default Model     | Fast Model            | Context Window |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Claude Haiku 4.5      | 200K tokens    |
| OpenAI    | GPT-4o            | GPT-4o-mini           | 128K tokens    |
| Google    | Gemini 2.5 Flash  | Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite | 1M tokens      |

Per-phase model routing (`LLM_<STAGE>_MODEL` overrides): fast models for classifier/synthesis/enrichment/vision, default models for quality-sensitive stages (plan, extraction).
