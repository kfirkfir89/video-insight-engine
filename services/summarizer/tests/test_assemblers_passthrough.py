"""Assembler passthrough tests for the 4.1 drift fix (project-score-9).

Adding fields to the Pydantic mirrors is not enough on its own — the assembler
normalizers (`_normalize_to_spot`, `_normalize_step`) whitelist which item
fields reach the frontend props. These tests pin the new TS-declared fields
(SpotItem: currency/bookingSearch/specs/rating; StepItem: title/safetyNote)
through the normalizers so the fix is effective end-to-end.
