"""Regression tests for the worker's pipeline driver.

The bug fixed here: ``drive_pipeline`` previously called
``get_video_repository()`` and ``get_llm_service()`` with no arguments, which
explodes outside of FastAPI's dependency-injection machinery (those functions
expect their dependencies as ``Annotated[..., Depends(...)]`` parameters). The
surface was only ever hit when a job actually drove the pipeline — which the
existing runner tests never did, since they mock the pipeline callable.

These tests exercise the *construction* path inside ``drive_pipeline`` to
guarantee we don't regress.
