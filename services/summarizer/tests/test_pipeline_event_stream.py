"""Tests for the Redis Streams pipeline event broker.

The broker fronts a fake aioredis client so the tests don't need a real
Redis server. We verify the contract that matters in production:

1. ``acquire_lock`` is single-winner under concurrent calls.
2. ``release_lock`` only deletes the lock if we still own it.
3. ``subscribe`` replays history from id="0" (so a late joiner sees the
   same events the first connection saw).
4. The DONE sentinel terminates ``subscribe`` cleanly.
5. If the producer disappears without DONE (lock TTL expired or crash),
   ``subscribe`` exits instead of hanging forever.
