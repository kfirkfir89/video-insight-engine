"""RabbitMQ-driven worker for the video summarization pipeline.

The runner separates **process_message** (pure async function, easy to test)
from the broker/loop concerns. Tests inject stubs for ``run_pipeline`` and
``republish``; the entrypoint (``__main__``) wires the real pipeline and an
aio-pika publisher.

Retry policy (matches docs/INFRASTRUCTURE.md):
- Validation error → reject(requeue=False) → DLX → DLQ
- Pipeline error & ``attempt < max_retries`` → republish with attempt+1,
  ack the original (treated as handled — the retry is a new message)
- Pipeline error & ``attempt >= max_retries`` → reject(requeue=False) → DLQ
