"""Post-extraction component promotion.

The planner (stage 3) runs *before* extraction (stage 4), so it can only pick
components from the title / chapter structure — it never sees the extracted
item counts, concept-connection graph, or frame coverage that the richer
components require. This module runs inside the assembler (stage 8), where
those facts ARE known, and upgrades a basic component to a richer sibling when
the data supports it.

Each rule re-shapes props by calling the *target* assembler (never a bare
rename) so a promoted tab is always render-valid; ``assemble_response``
re-validates the result immediately afterward.
