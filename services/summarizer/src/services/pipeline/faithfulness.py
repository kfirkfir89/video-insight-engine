"""LLM-as-Judge faithfulness check.

Samples a deterministic subset of extracted items, asks a Haiku-tier LLM
whether each claim is supported by the transcript, and logs an aggregate
score onto the active Langfuse trace.

Design notes
------------
- **Non-blocking by contract.** The judge runs as a fire-and-forget task
  attached to the pipeline trace. Failures are logged at debug level — the
  user-facing video output is never delayed by a faithfulness check.
- **Deterministic sampling.** The sample seed is derived from the
  ``youtube_id`` so the same video always gets the same items checked.
  That keeps day-to-day variance attributable to model drift rather than
  random sampling noise.
- **Cheap.** Haiku-tier judge, 20% sample, capped at 6 items per video.
  Per-video cost ~$0.005.
- **Claim-localized context.** Transcripts longer than the judged-context
  budget are not head-sliced — each claim is judged against the transcript
  windows that share the most (IDF-weighted) vocabulary with it, packed
  into the same budget in document order. Pure-python lexical scoring; no
  extra dependencies, no extra LLM calls.

# Sized for the default fast tier — Anthropic Haiku-4.5, 200K-token context;
# 80K chars ≈ 20K tokens leaves ample room for the judge prompt + claim.
# Transcripts within the budget pass through whole. Longer transcripts are
# NOT head-sliced (a 3h+ video head-slice meant tail claims were judged
# against text that could not contain them → false hallucination verdicts);
# instead the budget is filled with the transcript windows most lexically
# relevant to the claim being judged — see `_select_claim_context`.
#
# WARNING for operators: this constant is coupled to the judge model's
# context window. If LLM_FAST_MODEL or a per-stage faithfulness override
# routes the judge through a smaller-context model (e.g. an 8K-context
# legacy model), this budget will overflow the model's prompt limit and
# every judge call will error out. The diagnostic log in
# `run_faithfulness_check` emits `truncated=True` when the input transcript
# exceeds the budget; watch for that signal when swapping models.
