"""Redis Streams broker for pipeline SSE event fan-out.

One pipeline run per ``video_summary_id`` produces events that any number of
SSE consumers can attach to. The first request to acquire the per-video lock
becomes the producer; everyone else (StrictMode reconnects, additional tabs,
the processing-manager hook) just subscribes to the shared stream.

Key design properties:

- **Producer lifetime is independent of any single connection.** When a
  client aborts the SSE request (StrictMode unmount, page navigation, hard
  refresh), the producer task keeps running in the background.
- **Late joiners replay from the beginning.** ``XREAD`` with ``last_id="0"``
  returns the full event history retained in the stream, so a reconnect
  receives the same events the first connection saw.
- **Crash safety.** The lock has a TTL; if the worker process dies, the
  lock auto-expires and a future request can pick the work back up. The
  release path uses a Lua compare-and-delete so we never release a lock we
  no longer own.
