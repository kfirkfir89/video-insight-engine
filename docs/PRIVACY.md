# Privacy & Data Deletion

> User-facing summary of what we store and how to delete it. For the
> engineering runbook, see [`GDPR.md`](./GDPR.md).

## What we store

When you use Video Insight Engine, we keep:

| Data | Why | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Email + name | Sign-in identity | Our database |
| Encrypted password | Sign-in security | Our database (bcrypt-hashed) |
| Library entries (videos you've added) | So your library appears when you log in | Our database |
| Folders, playlists | Library organization | Our database |
| AI cost usage | Daily cost cap enforcement | Our database |
| Saved chat notes | The "Save note" action in the chat assistant | Our database |

We **do not** store:
- Your YouTube history outside what you explicitly added.
- Your IP address beyond aggregated, hashed counters on shared pages.
- Card or billing details (handled by [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/) — see "Billing data" below).

## How to delete your account

1. Open **Settings → Account → Delete account**.
2. Confirm. Your account is immediately frozen — you'll be logged out and unable to sign in.
3. We give you **30 days** to change your mind. Contact `support@…` during that window if you want to restore it.
4. After 30 days, every piece of your personal data is permanently removed from our systems. You'll receive a confirmation that deletion completed.

### What happens technically

After the 30-day grace period:

- Your user record and all rows pointing at it (library, folders, notes, daily cost log) are deleted from our database.
- An **audit row** is written so we can prove the deletion happened. The row contains a one-way hash of your email — not the email itself — plus the deletion timestamp and counts of what was removed. This satisfies our compliance obligations without keeping your personal data.

## What is NOT deleted

Three categories of data are not removed because they aren't yours:

1. **Video summaries** themselves (the AI-generated output) live in a shared cache. They're keyed by the YouTube video, not by the user. Removing them would break the same video for every other user who has it.
2. **Anonymous engagement signals** on public share pages (view counts, like counts) — these are stored as one-way hashes of IP addresses, never linked to your account.
3. **Aggregated billing/usage analytics** with a 90-day rolling window — these contain no PII and auto-expire.

If you specifically need every trace of a particular video removed, contact support.

## Billing data

Payments go through [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/). They store payment details under their own GDPR-compliant DPA. Account deletion at Video Insight Engine **also** removes our copy of the Paddle customer ID (so we can no longer issue charges), but the historical receipts at Paddle are governed by their retention policy. To request deletion of those, follow [Paddle's GDPR portal](https://www.paddle.com/legal/privacy).

## Data export

GDPR Article 20 (data portability) is being scoped separately. Until that ships, email `support@…` with a written request and we'll generate a JSON archive of your library and notes within 30 days.
