# GDPR Cascade Deletion — Engineer Runbook

## Goals

GDPR Article 17 (right to erasure) requires that when a user requests deletion, we **remove every piece of their personal data** from our live systems, with a documented audit trail. This document is the engineer's view of how that works in the codebase.

## Architecture at a glance

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DELETE /api/users/me` | JWT | Self-service soft delete. Returns 202 + `scheduledHardDeleteAt`. |
| `POST /api/users/me/restore` | JWT (bypasses soft-delete check) | Cancel a pending deletion within 30 days. |
| `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id?immediate=true` | `x-admin-key` header | Run the cascade now (compliance escape hatch). |
| `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id` (no `immediate`) | `x-admin-key` header | Schedule the same soft delete as the user-initiated flow. |
| `POST /internal/run-deletions` | `x-internal-secret` header | Cron entrypoint — sweeps `hardDeleteAt <= now` and runs the cascade for each. |

## Key files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `api/src/services/user-deletion.service.ts` | Saga orchestrator |
| `api/src/repositories/user.repository.ts` | `markSoftDeleted`, `clearSoftDelete`, `findExpiredSoftDeletes`, `hardDelete` |
| `api/src/repositories/user-deletion.repository.ts` | Audit row writer |
| `api/src/routes/users.routes.ts` | `DELETE /api/users/me`, restore, admin endpoints |
| `api/src/plugins/jwt.ts` | Per-request soft-delete check — kills active sessions immediately |
| `reports/user-data-inventory.md` | Source of truth for what's in/out of scope |

## The cascade (saga)

Steps run in `executeHardDelete()` in this exact order:

1. **`agentNotes`** (assistant service — shared MongoDB)
2. **`userVideos`** (library entries)
3. **`folders`**
4. **`userCosts`**
5. **`userCostAdjustments`**
6. **`idempotencyKeys`**
7. **Qdrant user content** (placeholder — see below)
8. **S3 user objects** (placeholder — see below)
9. **`users`** (the FK anchor, dropped last)
10. **`userDeletions`** audit insert

### Idempotency

Every step is naturally idempotent: `deleteMany({ userId: oid })` produces the same result whether it runs once or fifty times. If the cascade fails partway, re-invoking it is safe — the first delete-many is a no-op (nothing matches), the second processes the remainder.

### Error handling

Each step is wrapped in `runStep`, which catches and records the error as a `warning` on the audit row **without aborting**. The cascade always reaches the `users` row deletion. The rationale: leaving the smallest possible PII footprint matters more than rolling back when one downstream service is misbehaving. The audit row preserves the failure for follow-up.

### What's NOT deleted (and why)

| Store | Why we don't delete |
|---|---|
| `videoSummaryCache` | Shared cache, keyed by YouTube ID, not user. Deletion would break other users with the same video. |
| Qdrant `transcript_chunks` | Same — video-scoped, not user-scoped. `user_id` payload is reserved but always `null` today (see `services/summarizer/src/services/vector/qdrant_service.py:153`). When that payload starts being populated for user-generated content, the cascade step is ready to flip from no-op to real delete. |
| S3 `videos/{youtubeId}/...` | Same — video-scoped. No user-keyed S3 prefixes today; placeholder hook is wired for the future. |
| `llm_usage` | Anonymized cost telemetry with 90-day TTL. Eagerly deleting would distort daily cost reports. If legal needs shorter retention, hash the `user_id` field instead. |
| `shareLikes` / `shareViews` | Already anonymous (IP hashed). |
| Paddle records | Out of our system — directed at Paddle's own GDPR portal in [`PRIVACY.md`](./PRIVACY.md). |

## Soft-delete enforcement

A previously-issued JWT remains cryptographically valid for its 15-minute TTL even after the user is soft-deleted. To kill those sessions immediately, the `authenticate` hook in `api/src/plugins/jwt.ts` looks up the user on every request and returns **403 `ACCOUNT_DELETION_PENDING`** if `deletedAt` is set. The refresh-token cookie is also cleared on the `DELETE /api/users/me` response so the browser doesn't try to refresh into a frozen session.

`/api/users/me/restore` is the only authenticated endpoint that **does not** apply this check — by design, otherwise the user can never cancel.

## Running the scheduler

The scheduler is just an internal HTTP endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "x-internal-secret: $INTERNAL_SECRET" \
  http://vie-api:3000/internal/run-deletions
```

Drive it from any cron source — Kubernetes CronJob, GitHub Actions on a schedule, host crontab, BullMQ if/when we adopt it. Daily at 03:00 UTC is the recommended cadence; running more often is harmless because every step is idempotent and a no-op past the first run.

Example k8s CronJob skeleton:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: vie-gdpr-cascade
spec:
  schedule: "0 3 * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: trigger
            image: curlimages/curl
            args:
              - -X
              - POST
              - -H
              - "x-internal-secret: $(INTERNAL_SECRET)"
              - http://vie-api:3000/internal/run-deletions
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

## Audit log

`userDeletions` rows are **retained indefinitely** with no TTL. Each row holds:

- `originalUserId` (string form of the deleted ObjectId)
- `emailHash` — SHA-256 of the lowercased, trimmed email. Never the plaintext.
- `initiatedBy`: `'self' | 'admin' | 'scheduler'`
- `adminId`, `reason` — populated when `initiatedBy === 'admin'`
- `counts` — rows deleted per inventory bucket
- `startedAt`, `completedAt`, `durationMs`
- `warnings[]` — per-step error messages when the cascade didn't run cleanly

To prove a specific email was erased: hash the email with the same SHA-256 (lowercase, trim) and look it up in `userDeletions.emailHash`. The match plus the row's `completedAt` is the legal proof.

## Adding a new user-scoped data store

When you add a collection / payload / object prefix that ties to a user:

1. Add a step to `executeHardDelete()` in `user-deletion.service.ts`.
2. Add the corresponding count field to `DeletionCounts` in `user-deletion.repository.ts`.
3. Update [`reports/user-data-inventory.md`](../reports/user-data-inventory.md) under either the MongoDB / Qdrant / S3 table.
4. Add an assertion to the integration test in `api/src/services/__tests__/gdpr-cascade.integration.test.ts` proving the new data is removed.

Compliance is only as good as the inventory. Anything that touches user PII without showing up in the cascade is a future incident.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit + saga tests
cd api && npx vitest run src/services/__tests__/user-deletion.service.test.ts

# Repository tests
cd api && npx vitest run src/repositories/__tests__/user.repository.test.ts

# Route tests
cd api && npx vitest run src/routes/users.routes.test.ts

# Full end-to-end compliance gate
cd api && npx vitest run src/services/__tests__/gdpr-cascade.integration.test.ts
```

The integration test seeds every collection in the inventory, runs the cascade, and asserts zero rows + audit-log row exists. If it fails, deletion no longer satisfies Article 17 — **do not merge** until it passes again.
