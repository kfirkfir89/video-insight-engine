# LLM Cost Model

How VIE accounts for LLM token spend, including Anthropic prompt-caching credit.

## Recording

Every LiteLLM call writes one row to MongoDB `llm_usage` via
`MongoDBUsageCallback._build_record` (`packages/llm-common/src/llm_common/callback.py`).
The callback is registered as `litellm.callbacks = [callback]` on service startup
and is the single source of truth for cost — there is no manual tracking path
in the hot loop.

## Schema

`UsageRecord` (`packages/llm-common/src/llm_common/models.py`):

| Field                     | Source                                              | Notes |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `model`                   | `kwargs["model"]`                                   | LiteLLM model string, e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `provider`                | derived from `model`                                | `anthropic` / `openai` / `gemini` / `unknown` |
| `tokens_in`               | `response.usage.prompt_tokens`                      | Includes uncached + cache-create + cache-read |
| `tokens_out`              | `response.usage.completion_tokens`                  | |
| `cost_usd`                | `litellm.completion_cost(response)`                 | Provider-billed cost, already net of cache discount |
| `cache_creation_tokens`   | `usage.cache_creation_input_tokens`                 | Tokens that wrote into the cache this call |
| `cache_read_tokens`       | `usage.cache_read_input_tokens`                     | Tokens served from the cache this call |
| `cache_hit`               | `_hidden_params.cache_hit` or `cache_read > 0`      | Either signal triggers True |
| `cache_savings_usd`       | `compute_cache_savings_usd(model, cache_read)`      | See below |
| `feature` / `video_id`    | `llm_feature_var` / `llm_video_id_var`              | Set by call sites via context vars |
| `user_id`                 | `llm_user_id_var`                                   | Owner of the run; the key per-user reconciliation matches on. `None` on legacy rows |
| `video_summary_id`        | `llm_video_summary_id_var`                          | The Mongo `videoSummaryCache` id for this run |
| `request_id`              | `llm_request_id_var`                                | Per-run grouping key — one POST = one `request_id`; a regeneration gets a fresh one. `None` on legacy rows |
| `service`                 | callback ctor arg                                   | `summarizer` / `assistant` / etc. |
| `is_stream`               | `kwargs["stream"]`                                  | True when LiteLLM was streamed |
| `unit`                    | emitter                                             | `tokens` (default) or `audio_seconds` for transcription rows |
| `audio_seconds`           | emitter                                             | Billed audio duration for Whisper rows; `0.0` for token-priced rows |

## Transcription cost tracking

Whisper and Gemini transcription call provider SDKs directly (OpenAI /
`google.genai`), bypassing LiteLLM — so `MongoDBUsageCallback` never fires for
them. Without explicit tracking those calls are silently `$0`, which is material:
Whisper-1 bills `$0.006/min`, so a 1-hour audio-fallback video is ~`$0.36`.

The transcribers emit their own rows via `llm_common.record_manual_usage`, which
writes through the **same active buffer** the callback owns
(`register_active_buffer`, set in `MongoDBUsageCallback.__init__`) and fills
run-attribution (`user_id` / `video_id` / `video_summary_id` / `request_id`) from
the same context vars the pipeline already set — so transcription rows inherit
the run's attribution for free. The shared emit helper
(`services/summarizer/src/services/transcription/usage.py`) also logs a
`transcription:<provider>` generation under the pipeline's Langfuse trace.

- **Whisper** (`whisper_transcriber.py`) — `unit="audio_seconds"`,
  `audio_seconds=response.duration`, cost via `compute_transcription_cost_usd`
  (`$0.006/min`). Features: `summarize:transcript:whisper` /
  `:whisper_translate`.
- **Gemini** (`gemini_transcriber.py`) — `unit="tokens"`, token counts from
  `response.usage_metadata`, cost via the per-token Gemini rate. Feature:
  `summarize:transcript:gemini`.
- A failed transcription emits `success=False`, `cost_usd=0` (failed provider
  calls bill nothing). Tracking is best-effort and never breaks transcription.

Rates live in `_TRANSCRIPTION_RATES_USD` (`models.py`); an unmapped model logs
`transcription.rate_missing` once and costs `$0` — same drift-visibility pattern
as `compute_cache_savings_usd`.

**Billing policy:** transcription cost is **counted against the user daily cap**
— it is real spend. Because the rows carry `cost_usd` + `user_id`, they flow into
`reconcileUserDay` automatically with no extra wiring; no exclusion filter is
applied. (NB: only processes that register a `MongoDBUsageCallback` emit these
rows — the FastAPI summarizer does; the standalone RabbitMQ worker does not
register a callback, so transcription run through the queue-only path is
untracked, same as all other `llm_usage` on that path.)

The summarizer sets `user_id`, `video_summary_id`, `video_id`, and `request_id`
in `pipeline_runner.py` **before** the cache lookup, so every row a run writes is
attributable. `user_id` and `request_id` come from the **structlog contextvars
the worker binds from the queue payload** — *not* from the cache row, which is the
cross-user `videoSummaryCache` doc and carries no per-run owner. The assistant sets
`feature` (`assistant:rag_chat` / `assistant:library_chat` /
`assistant:action:<action>` / `assistant:tool:<name>`), `video_id`, `user_id`, and
`request_id` at each endpoint (from `X-User-Id` / `X-Request-ID` headers the API
gateway forwards) and in the tool router.
Rows written before this (no `user_id` / `request_id`) are treated as
"unattributed (legacy)" by admin — fix-forward only, no historical backfill.

## Cache savings calculation

`compute_cache_savings_usd` multiplies cache-read tokens by the per-1M-token
delta between the input rate and the cached-read rate. Anthropic publishes
cached reads at ~10% of the normal input rate; for Sonnet 4.6 that's
$0.30/MTok vs $3.00/MTok.

```python
delta = rates["input"] - rates["cache_read"]
savings = (cache_read_tokens / 1_000_000) * delta
```

The rate map lives in `_CACHE_RATES_USD_PER_M`. When a model lacks a mapping,
savings are reported as `0.0` and the missing model is logged once
(`cache.rate_missing`) — under-reporting is preferred over inventing numbers.

`cost_usd` is the provider-billed cost (already net of the cache discount).
`cache_savings_usd` is what we *would* have paid had the read tokens been
billed at the full input rate, so total list-price spend ≈ `cost_usd + cache_savings_usd`.

## Where cache_control is set

`services/summarizer/src/services/llm_provider.py:162-169` — when
`cache_static` is provided and the model is Anthropic, the static prompt half
is sent as a separate system message with `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}`.
LiteLLM forwards the directive to the Anthropic API.

The current cached blocks are:
- `services/summarizer/src/prompts/base_extraction.txt` (extraction)
- `services/summarizer/src/prompts/plan.txt` (plan stage)

Plus the dynamic prompt in `complete_with_messages` is appended afterward.

## How to audit

Run the audit script:

```bash
python scripts/audit_cache_credits.py                  # last 24h
python scripts/audit_cache_credits.py --hours 1        # last hour
python scripts/audit_cache_credits.py --video-id <id>  # one video
python scripts/audit_cache_credits.py --json           # machine-readable
```

Exit codes:
- `0` cache hits observed on Anthropic calls
- `1` no records in window
- `2` Anthropic calls present but zero cache hits — investigate

## Common failure modes

1. **Zero hits on Sonnet calls** — usually means the static prompt half is
   not byte-identical between calls (e.g., a timestamp or user_goal slipped
   in). Re-grep call sites for variable interpolation in cached blocks.
2. **`cache.rate_missing` log** — a model alias was added in `config.MODEL_MAP`
   without a corresponding entry in `_CACHE_RATES_USD_PER_M`. Add the
   per-1M-token rates for that model.
3. **`cost_usd = 0`** — LiteLLM doesn't know the price for a custom-named
   model (e.g. a date-stamped Anthropic preview). Map the alias to a known
   model in LiteLLM's pricing table or accept zero cost reporting until the
   model goes GA.

## Status of P1 work

- ✅ Cache fields on `UsageRecord` (creation/read tokens, hit flag, savings)
- ✅ Per-model cache rate map with miss-logging fallback
- ✅ `cache_control: ephemeral` set on extraction + plan static halves
- ✅ Audit script (`scripts/audit_cache_credits.py`)
- 📋 Live audit pending production traffic — run the script after one
      end-to-end pipeline run to confirm the second-pass call hits the cache.

## Per-user daily cap

`llm_usage` rows (Python schema) are aggregated per-user into the `userCosts`
collection by `CostMonitorService.reconcileUserDay` /
`reconcileAllUsersForDay`. The aggregate feeds two gates:

1. **POST /api/videos** — `reserveUserCost(userId, tier)` atomically increments
   the day's `totalCostUsd` by an over-estimate, then refunds-and-throws
   `DailyLimitReachedError` (HTTP 429) if the user is already past
   `COST_LIMITS_PER_TIER[tier]`. The increment-then-check pattern serializes
   concurrent submissions on the per-user/day doc — see the regression test
   `should serialize concurrent reservations on the same user/day`.
2. **GET /api/users/me/usage** — returns today's effective spend, headroom,
   and the next UTC midnight reset for the in-app usage tile.

Reconciliation runs on every terminal video status (`completed` / `failed`)
via the internal status callback, and nightly via `POST /internal/reconcile-costs`.
The terminal-status path is the canonical refund-on-failure — do not also
call `refundReservation` on failure, or the day will be double-credited.

The Node `CostMonitorService.recordUsage` writes a **different** schema
(`model`, `cost`, `createdAt`) that reconciliation does **not** read; use it
only for global cost telemetry, not for per-user attribution.

Admin grants and manual charges go through `userCostAdjustments` (signed
storage: negative = credit) — see [DATA-MODELS.md](./DATA-MODELS.md#usercostadjustments)
and [SERVICE-ADMIN.md](./SERVICE-ADMIN.md#per-user-costs-users).

## Ledger Retention (decided 2026-07-06)

`llm_usage` is the financial ledger. **Rows are retained indefinitely** — the
former 90-day TTL index silently erased billing history and was removed
(`api/src/plugins/mongodb.ts` now drops the legacy TTL index at startup and
recreates `createdAt` as a plain index). Rationale: personal-scale volume
(thousands of rows/month at most) makes rollups unnecessary, and cost audits /
cache-credit reconciliation need the raw rows. Revisit only if the collection
exceeds ~1M rows; the fallback design is a monthly rollup collection populated
before any re-introduced expiry.

The vie-admin lifespan **also** drops any legacy 90-day TTL on `llm_usage`
(`timestamp_1` — it used to recreate one on every boot) and recreates
`timestamp` as a plain index, so either service booting first heals the ledger.

## Alerting (implemented 2026-07-12)

Three thresholds, all real:

| Alert type | Evaluated by | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `high_cost_call` | `llm_common.callback.MongoDBUsageCallback` (inline, per LLM call) | single call cost > `cost_threshold` (constructor default $0.50) |
| `daily_spend_spike` | vie-admin `alert_evaluator` loop (every 5 min) | today's spend > `daily_spike_multiplier` × trailing 7-day daily average (baseline must be ≥ $0.50/day) |
| `high_failure_rate` | vie-admin `alert_evaluator` loop (every 5 min) | failure rate over the trailing 60 min > `failure_rate_threshold`, with ≥ 10 calls in the window |

The spike/failure thresholds are read live from `llm_alert_config` (managed by
`POST /alerts/config` in vie-admin), which was previously decorative. Per-type
cooldowns (6 h spike, 1 h failure) stop a sustained condition from re-alerting
every cycle.

**Delivery:** every alert is written to `llm_alerts` (rendered by the admin UI)
and POSTed as JSON to `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` when set (Slack-compatible generic
webhook / ntfy / any HTTP catcher). The URL must be `http(s)://` — any other
scheme is rejected (logged, no send). Empty URL → Mongo-only. Delivery is
best-effort with a 3 s timeout and never breaks the LLM call or the evaluator;
the webhook fires even when the Mongo write fails. Senders:
`packages/llm-common/src/llm_common/alerts.py` (stdlib urllib, sync services)
and `services/admin/src/services/alert_evaluator.py` (httpx, async).
