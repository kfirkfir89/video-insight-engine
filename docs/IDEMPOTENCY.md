# Pipeline Idempotency Keys

Request-level dedup for `POST /api/videos`. Same inputs within the TTL window return the cached `videoSummaryId` instead of running a fresh pipeline.

## Why

Three failure modes that cost the user real money:

1. **Double-click** — user clicks Generate twice; two pipelines start.
2. **Browser retry** — network blip auto-resends; user is charged twice.
3. **Refresh-while-submitting** — user reloads before redirect; new submit fires.

Idempotency keys make these silent successes — the second submission attaches to the first.

## How it works

```
POST /api/videos
  ↓ Auth + Tier
  ↓ Validate Idempotency-Key header (optional, ≤255 printable ASCII) — HTTP 400 if malformed
  ↓ Extract youtubeId
  ↓ Compute hash = SHA-256(userId : youtubeId : PIPELINE_VERSION : providers [: client : headerValue])
  ↓ reserveHash (atomic insert of a `pending` placeholder on unique-hash index)
  ↓
  ├─ created=true (we won the race):
  │    reserveUserCost → videoService.createVideo → completeHash
  │    Return result with { cached: bool } (HTTP 201)
  │
  └─ created=false (someone got there first):
       ├─ existing.status === 'completed' + userVideo still exists
       │    → return it with { duplicate: true, cached: true }  (HTTP 200)
       │
       ├─ existing.status === 'completed' + userVideo deleted
       │    → invalidateStaleCompleted(hash, observed videoSummaryId)
       │    → retry reserveHash:
       │        ├─ created=true → fall through to normal creation flow
       │        └─ created=false → HTTP 409 IDEMPOTENCY_IN_FLIGHT (lost the retry race)
       │
       └─ existing.status === 'pending' (original still processing)
            → HTTP 409 IDEMPOTENCY_IN_FLIGHT
```

The stale-hit cleanup uses `invalidateStaleCompleted(hash, videoSummaryId)` rather than a plain `deleteOne({ hash })` so a concurrent fresh reservation cannot be accidentally deleted: the delete is scoped to the exact `(hash, status: 'completed', videoSummaryId)` triple we observed.

On `status: 'failed'` from the summarizer, `idempotencyService.invalidateByVideoSummaryId(videoSummaryId)` drops the key so the user can retry immediately rather than wait out the TTL. `completeHash` is also status-scoped (`{ hash, status: 'pending' }`) so a late completion cannot stomp a row that was already cleaned up and re-reserved.

## Hash inputs

The system uses **two key shapes** in different layers:

### Per-user idempotency hash (request layer)

SHA-256 of `userId:youtubeId:PIPELINE_VERSION:providersHash`. Owned by `idempotencyService.computeKey()`; gates `POST /api/videos` against the same user double-submitting.

- **`userId`** — namespaces per user so cross-user collisions are impossible.
- **`youtubeId`** — the canonical 11-char ID (URL params stripped upstream).
- **`PIPELINE_VERSION`** — canonical version string, single-sourced from `packages/shared/src/config/pipeline-version.json` (NOT an env var; both the api and the summarizer read the same file). **Bump the JSON on every meaningful pipeline change** — all stale keys auto-miss.
- **`providersHash`** — stable JSON of the provider override (`default`/`fast`/`fallback`). Empty when not supplied. Two different provider configs produce two different hashes.

When a client supplies an `Idempotency-Key` header (Stripe convention), the header value is **mixed INTO** the payload (it does not replace it). The hash becomes `SHA-256(userId:youtubeId:PIPELINE_VERSION:providersHash:client:headerValue)`. This is stricter than Stripe's "same key + different params is an error" semantic — different params with the same header simply produce a different hash, so the work runs fresh. We trade the ability to dedup arbitrary payloads for the guarantee that reusing a key by mistake never returns the wrong video.

The header is validated to 1-255 printable ASCII characters (`/^[\x21-\x7E]{1,255}$/`); other values return HTTP 400 `INVALID_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY`.

### Cross-user content-addressed key (cache layer)

SHA-256 of `youtubeId:PIPELINE_VERSION:providersHash:v<version>`. **No `userId`** — that's the point: two different users submitting the same video collapse onto a single `videoSummaryCache` row instead of running the pipeline twice.

Owned by `computeContentKey()` (free function in `api/src/services/idempotency.service.ts`, also exposed as `IdempotencyService.computeContentKey()`). Stored as `videoSummaryCache.dedupKey` with a partial unique index on `{$exists: true}` so legacy pre-backfill rows coexist.

Entry point: `VideoRepository.upsertCacheByDedupKey(...) → { doc, wasInsert }` — atomic `findOneAndUpdate` with `$setOnInsert`. Exactly one concurrent caller sees `wasInsert: true` and is responsible for dispatching the pipeline; the rest attach to the existing row.

`version` is included so a `bypassCache` version-bump (which deliberately starts a fresh pipeline run) produces a distinct key from the existing row, while two concurrent first-time submits both targeting `v1` collapse correctly.

### Dispatch guard (publish layer)

Belt-and-suspenders Redis lock above the content-addressed upsert. The upsert collapses concurrent submits at the cache row; the dispatch guard catches the narrower window where two API replicas race outside Mongo's serialization, or where `dispatchPipeline` is called twice for the same row (e.g. a failed-retry firing while a prior dispatch is still in-flight).

- **Files**: `api/src/services/dispatch-guard.service.ts` + `api/src/plugins/redis.ts`.
- **Key**: `vie:api:dispatched:<videoSummaryId>`.
- **Acquire**: `SET NX EX <DISPATCH_GUARD_TTL_SECONDS>` — atomic. On win, the caller gets a token (`randomUUID`) it must pass to `release()`.
- **Release**: Lua compare-and-delete using the token (safe even if a fresh attempt re-acquired after TTL expiry). With `token: null`, blind `DEL` — used by `internal.routes.ts` on terminal FAILED status from the summarizer.
- **Release on throw**: `dispatchPipeline()` wraps the entire publish path in try/catch and releases the guard if any publish call throws, so a transient broker error doesn't strand the guard for the full TTL.
- **Fail-open contract**: any Redis error returns `acquired: true` so the caller proceeds. Rationale — the summarizer's per-`video_summary_id` lock at `services/summarizer/src/services/cache/pipeline_event_stream.py` is the last line of defense and dedups even if we double-publish; a Redis outage silently dropping user submissions would be far worse.
- **TTL**: `DISPATCH_GUARD_TTL_SECONDS` defaults to 900s. **Must exceed** the summarizer's `PIPELINE_LOCK_TTL_SECONDS` (default 600s) so the guard doesn't expire while the pipeline lock is still held — 50% headroom by default.
- **REDIS_URL**: Both the API (dispatch guard) and the summarizer (pipeline lock + response cache) must point at the **same** Redis instance for operational coherence.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `PIPELINE_VERSION` | (from `packages/shared/src/config/pipeline-version.json`) | Canonical version string baked into both the per-user idempotency hash AND the cross-user `dedupKey`, namespacing the summarizer's Redis response cache, and stamped as `pipelineVersion` on every persisted Mongo summary doc. **Not an env var** — single-sourced from the shared JSON so the api and summarizer can never diverge. Bump the JSON on prompt/schema/pipeline changes. |
| `IDEMPOTENCY_TTL_SECONDS` | `86400` (24h) | Per-key TTL for `idempotencyKeys`. Long enough for accidental double-submits; short enough that "I want to retry tomorrow" works. |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://vie-redis:6379` | Redis connection for the dispatch guard. Must be the same instance the summarizer uses for its per-video pipeline lock. |
| `DISPATCH_GUARD_TTL_SECONDS` | `900` | TTL on `vie:api:dispatched:<videoSummaryId>`. Must exceed the summarizer's `PIPELINE_LOCK_TTL_SECONDS` (default 600s). |

## When to bump `PIPELINE_VERSION`

Bump on **any** change that would change pipeline OUTPUT for the same input. Examples:

- Prompt rewrites (extraction, synthesis, enrichment, plan)
- Domain schema changes (new fields, renamed fields, type changes)
- Model version changes (e.g. switching from Sonnet 4.5 → 4.6 by default)
- Assembly rule changes that affect tab shape
- Cross-tab link rule additions

Do **NOT** bump for:

- Logging changes, observability, instrumentation
- Performance optimizations that don't change output
- Bug fixes that don't change the happy-path output
- Frontend-only changes

**Rule of thumb**: if a user re-running the same video would get a different result, bump.

> **Note**: bumping `PIPELINE_VERSION` invalidates **both** the per-user idempotency hash AND the cross-user content-addressed `dedupKey` — same input, different version = different keys in both layers, so every stale row is bypassed atomically on the next request. It also shifts the summarizer's Redis response-cache namespace (stale entries TTL out) and arms the serve-path regen check: completed Mongo docs **stamped** with an older `pipelineVersion` are re-run on the user's next submission instead of being served stale. Docs **without** a `pipelineVersion` field predate stamping and are always served as-is (current-legacy) — a bump never mass-invalidates them, so no out-of-band DB flush is needed or wanted.

### Procedure

1. Pick a new version string. Convention: `v{N}` (e.g. `v8` → `v9`). Date-suffixed (`v9-2026-08-25`) is also fine for traceability.
2. Edit `version` in `packages/shared/src/config/pipeline-version.json` — the single source for the api AND the summarizer.
3. Restart both services (compose mounts the JSON read-only into both containers; both log `pipeline_version` at boot — the two lines must match).
4. Old keys remain in `idempotencyKeys` until their TTL expires; they just no longer match new submissions. Old cache rows keep serving to users who already own them until they resubmit (stamped-stale docs then regen on the same row).

**Current version: `v8`** (2026-08: v6→v7 consistency overhaul — playbooks/forbidden, adaptive vision tiers; v7→v8 moment redesign + exact-timestamp frame fill + hi-res frame pipeline).

### Unification note (2026-07-08)

Before single-sourcing, the api hardcoded `v2` while the summarizer hardcoded `v6`. The canonical file adopted **`v6`** (the summarizer's lineage — it names the output schema, and keeps the Redis response cache warm). Adopting `v6` api-side changes every idempotency hash and `dedupKey` computed under `v2`: in-flight `idempotencyKeys` rows (≤24h TTL) orphan harmlessly, and pre-unification `videoSummaryCache.dedupKey` values become unreachable for **new** cross-user submissions — the first re-submission of such a video runs the pipeline once more, after which the new row dedups normally. Same-user resubmissions are unaffected (matched via `userVideos`, not `dedupKey`). At unification time the live DB had 0 `idempotencyKeys` rows and 0 `dedupKey`-carrying cache rows, so the switch was a no-op in practice.

## Bypass for power users

`POST /api/videos?bypassCache=true` skips the idempotency gate entirely. Use when a user explicitly wants a fresh run (admin tool, paid feature). The route's existing `bypassCache` flag handles this.

Beyond the gate, `bypassCache` also has to defeat the summarizer's **Redis response cache** (keyed by youtubeId + PIPELINE_VERSION, so a version bump alone doesn't help a same-version refresh). Two channels carry the signal, because either side can win the producer race:

1. The api stamps `forceRefresh: true` on the fresh `videoSummaryCache` version row; `pipeline_runner.stream_summarization` reads it (`force_refresh or entry.forceRefresh`) and the repository `$unset`s it on completion.
2. Queue submissions pass `force_refresh` in the worker payload (`drive_pipeline` → `produce_to_broker(force_refresh=…)`).

Either one makes the summarizer skip the Redis response cache and run the pipeline fresh.

## Collection schema

`idempotencyKeys` collection, indexes:

| Index | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `{ hash: 1 } unique` | Hash lookup + race-safe insertion. |
| `{ expiresAt: 1 } expireAfterSeconds: 0` | TTL eviction (~60s precision). |
| `{ videoSummaryId: 1 } sparse` | Failure cascade — drop all keys for a failed summary. Sparse because pending placeholders carry no videoSummaryId. |
| `{ userId: 1, createdAt: -1 }` | Audit/debug; not on the hot path. |

## Cost protection

The gate runs **before** `costMonitorService.reserveUserCost()`. A duplicate hit:

- Does NOT reserve cost (`reserveUserCost` not called).
- Does NOT enqueue a job (`queuePublisher.publishVideoJob` not called).
- Does NOT trigger HTTP summarization (`summarizerClient.triggerSummarization` not called).
- Returns instantly from a single Mongo read.

This is enforced by integration tests in `api/src/routes/videos.routes.test.ts`.

## DoS bound

An authenticated client can produce unique hashes by varying the `Idempotency-Key` header while keeping the YouTube URL constant. Each unique hash inserts one row in `idempotencyKeys` that lives until TTL (24h default). The blast radius is bounded by:

- The `VIDEO_DAILY_LIMIT` daily quota counted by `@fastify/rate-limit` — the per-user POST budget.
- The TTL index — old rows are reaped lazily (~60s precision) after `expiresAt`.
- Per-user authentication — every insert is tied to a real account.

If you need a tighter cap, add a `count({ userId, status: 'pending' })` guard in the route before `reserveHash`. The current design treats the per-user daily limit as the gating control.

## Frontend behaviour

On `result.duplicate === true`, the frontend shows a subtle sonner toast — *"Already processed — opening existing result"* — and navigates to the existing VideoDetail page. The toast helper lives at `apps/web/src/features/video-output/lib/duplicate-toast.ts` and is invoked from `VideoIntakeForm`, `AddVideoInput`, and `BoardInlinePaste`.
